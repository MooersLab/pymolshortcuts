# pymolshortcuts

This repository for ***pymolschortucts.py*** which contains 187 functions in 20 categories mapped to short-names that work like *aliases* or *shortcuts* (the table below is incomplete).
These shortcuts include many convenience functions that make work in PyMOL more productive and fun!
Some shortcuts save the many hours of work required to assemble a new script file while other shortcuts save only a few minutes but lower motivational barriers.
You do not need to understand Python to be able run the script.
To have the shortcuts always available, add the command 'run ~/pymolshortcuts.py' to your pymolrc or pymolrc.pml file in your home directory to load the functions in pymolshortcuts.py on startup of PyMOL.
In spite of the command *run*, the functions will be loaded into memory but not executed.
Enter **SC** to get a list of shortcuts printed to the command history window.
Enter **help PW** to print the documentation for the shortcut **PW** to the command history window.
While most shortcuts are ready to use, some shortcuts require the path names to the executables on your computer and some requrie access to Python modules that were not packaged with the incentive version of PyMOL.
Use help(shortcutname) to learn how to install the required module(s).

For example, the **BW** command makes cartoon or sphere representations of the currently loaded molecule into black and white figures suitable for classroom handouts and coloring books for aspiring scientists.

The shortcut **PW** takes one or more search terms and the sends them to the PyMOL Wiki.
A browser tab opens for each search term, so multiple searches are run in parallel while you continue your work in PyMOL.
You can inspect the results of the searches when there is a natural break in your work in PyMOL.
Other search functions can submit parallel searches of PubMed, Google, bioRxiv, Research Gate, GitHub, and more.
See the tables below.

Another class of shortcuts launch your favorite full-featured text editor from within PyMOL.
You have to install the text editor and edit the file path to the executable.

Another class of shortcuts opens the manuscript or grant application that you are working on in Overleaf.
You have to edit the script by pasting in the appropriate link to the specific document.

Another class of shortcuts saves files with timestamps embedded in the filename to avoid overwriting png, pdb, pse, and other types of files written out from PyMOL.
These save function names begin with **s**, (e.g., **spse filename** saves the current session with date and time to nearest second embedded in the file name).
You can delete the unwanted version(s) at a latter time. 
These functions are useful if you do not have these files under version control.

The functions are stored in a single file: pymolshortcuts.py

Edit the file paths to outside executables like text editors.
The shortcuts work best on the command line below the command history window because you can copy and paste text onto this command line.
 
Videos that demonstrate representatives from each class of shortcut are planned.
