# pymolshortcuts
The repository ***pymolschortucts*** contains over 200 functions mapped to short-names that work like aliases. 
These shortcuts include many other convienence functions that make work in PyMOL more productive.
For example, the shortcut **PW** takes one or more search terms and the sends them to the PyMOL Wiki.
A browser tab opens for each search term to run multiple searches in parallel.


The functions are stored in a single file: pymolshortcuts.py
Add the command 'run ~/pymolshortcuts.py' to your pymolrc or pymolrc.pml to load the functions in pymolshortcuts.py on startup of PyMOL.
In spite of the command *run*, the functions well be loaded into memory but not executed.
Enter **SC** to get a list of shortcuts printed to the command history window.
Enter **help PW** to have the documentation for the function PW() printed to the command history window.
